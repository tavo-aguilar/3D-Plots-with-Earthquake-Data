# 3D-Plots-with-Earthquake-Data
3D modeling of Earthquake data using pandas and numpy


## Overview
This repository aims to model earthquakes over the last 5 years along the Mariana's trench. Since 2D modleing will not be optimal when trying to model the locations of each earthquake, 3D figures are needed. A 3D model let's us assign x,y, and z vaues for each earthquake. With the use of python packages (numpy, matplotlib, and pandas), we take a dataset and use data filtering techniques to make 3D figures.

## Background
Earthquakes are events that always occur on earth and are studied through the branch of seismology. With the continued study of these events, we are more accurately report and locate each earthquake. Modeling earthquakes can help us better understand and visualize how these events occur. With the use of gathered data, we can recognize trends, such as earthquakes with higher energy release tend to be deeper in the Earth. 

## Methods
This python file uses numpy, matplotlib and pandas to generate figures that model the given data. We define boundaries for our figure and use pandas filtering and export them to numpy arrays. Multiple figures are then genrated to be able to display the data from different views. Another way to display the data is to make each point proportional to the energy released.

## Results

The results from this dataset is modeled from two different point of views from the primary python file ("3D Plots with Earthquake data"), with points being placed accordingly with deeper points at lower parts of the figure. These are figures from the primary file:

-Another figure can be generated by using the plotly package on the same dataset. The package makes the dataset interactive and allows us to select points on the figure if we choose, as well as assigning color to each data point to correspond to depth. Deeper points have darker colors and vice versa. The output from this package looks as so:

-If we decided we wanted to display the data and wanted the points to each have a magnitude proportional to the energy released, the plot from this dataset gives an output as follows:

Some key findings include that the smallest earthquake magnitude is 5.0, while the largest magnitude is 7.4 in the dataset. We also notice that the earthquakes with higher energy release are at deeper locations, which is consistant with what is already understood. 

## How to Run
- To run the primary file, the dataset ('last5years.csv') must be downloaded and a path to load it into a pandas dataframe must be done first. Once the data is loaded, you can clone the code from the primary python file ("3D Plots with Earthquake data") into a python IDE of choice and run to reproduce figures. 

- If you wish to produce the interactive plot, clone the code from the python file that reads "3d Plottting go figure" after running the primary python file. 

- To produce the plot that displays the energy released at each point, you can clone from the "3D Plot with Energy Released" into a python IDE of your choice. I do recommend running the primary file first to ensure your data is loaded properly!
