# 3D-Plots-with-Earthquake-Data
3D modeling of Earthquake data using pandas and numpy


## Overview
Brief explanation of what this project does and why it matters.
(2–4 sentences)

This repository aims to model earthquakes over the last 5 years along the Mariana's trench. Since 2D modleing will not be optimal when trying to model the locations of each earthquake, 3D figures are needed. A 3D model let's us assign x,y, and z vaues for each earthquake. With the use of python packages (numpy, matplotlib, and pandas), we take a dataset and use data filtering techniques to make 3D figures for a given dataset
